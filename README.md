# OneMoreIdea

An API for a website where users can post and explore different ideas for their pet projects. Project ideas can be categorized using one or more labels that make it easier to navigate and search if one needs something specific. A label may describe a preferred programming language, a technology, a pattern, or a topic e.g. "social network", "recommendation service".
